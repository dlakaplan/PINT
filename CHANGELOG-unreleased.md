## Unreleased
### Changed
- In `Residuals`, store correlated noise amplitudes instead of noise residuals. `Residuals.noise_resids` is now a `@property`.

- Simulate correlated DM noise for wideband TOAs
- Type hints in `pint.models.timing_model`
### Fixed
- Made `TimingModel.is_binary()` more robust. 
### Removed
- Definition of `@cached_property` to support Python<=3.7
- The broken `data.nanograv.org` URL from the list of solar system ephemeris mirrors
